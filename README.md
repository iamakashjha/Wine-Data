# Wine Quality Prediction
We are using machine learning to check wine quality.

This dataset was picked up from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality

Description of Dataset:

* volatile acidity :   Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.
* fixed acidity :   Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
* residual sugar :   Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
* citric acid :    It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.
* chlorides :   Amount of salt present in wine.
* free sulfur dioxide :   So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
* total sulfur dioxide 
* pH :   In wine pH is used for checking acidity
* density 
* sulphates :    Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
* alcohol :   Percent of alcohol present in wine.

Rather than chemical features, We can see, there is one feature named Type it contains the types of wine we here discuss on red and white wine, the percent of red wine is greater than white.
